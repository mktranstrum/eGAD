Most of the data files can be read (and were generated) using the code in the jupyter notebook GADExperiments.ipynb notebook.

* The random feature models were all generated and plotted using the jupyter notebook GADExperiments.ipynb.  
Results are saved as .npz files in this directory.
* Collocation data is in a separate subdirectory, stored as .csv files
* Cluster expansion data is in the two files CEdata-physicist-order.csv and CEdata-random-order.csv in this directory.


The only remaining files are for the "adding points" experiments, which are saved in the files Legendre_leggauss400.npz and Legendre_random400.npz.  These can be accessed (and were generated) using the jupyter notebook AddingTrainingPoints.ipynb.
